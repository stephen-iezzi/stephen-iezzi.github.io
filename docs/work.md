## My Background
Previously, I’ve worked on diverse data science and machine learning projects, including a computer vision system for a Fortune 500 client and an LLM-powered chatbot for a leading publisher, utilizing their extensive content archive to intelligently serve subscribers using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

What I’ve learned through these experiences is that many businesses rush into AI product development without a clear, strategic approach, leaving value untapped. You don’t need a massive budget or endless features to see meaningful results, what you need is to focus on the fundamentals: understanding your data, prioritizing quality, and iterating quickly. By taking calculated steps and avoiding common pitfalls, AI can become a powerful tool to solve user problems and deliver impact.
